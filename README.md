## Introduction:

Please check the upstream repo for the original project. All credits belong to the original authors. Unfortunately the upstream project seems to be dead.

For a motorized handcart I want to use a PS3 controller which is connected to a RPI3. So far nearly everything was working except the buttons square, triangle, circle and cross. Those buttons were reported as dead or unknown.

### Build Requirements:
This project has been built in the following environment.
 - Please check the upstream branch for the original project
 - I have updated the java version to 1.8 and removed some ant-build-warnings
